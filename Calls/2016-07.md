## Open311 Validator

Phil Ashlock provided a demo of the [Open311 Validator](http://validate.open311.org/) which is still primarily limited to validating the schema of JSON output. We clarified that the validator is for the 2.1 spec which doesn't yet have human readable documentation on the wiki and is currently limited to the Swagger file. However, a human readable version of the 2.1 spec draft is being developed based on the Swagger file. This doesn't yet show much detail on the schema without looking at the Swagger YAML, but you can see the current version on the [GeoReport v2.1 Swagger](/GeoReport_v2.1_Swagger/) page. We encourage folks to report any validator problems or suggestions as [new issues](https://github.com/open311/schema-validation/issues). 

## NYC 311 Inquiry Dataset

Chenda Fruchter provided some background on the recently released [NYC 311 Inquiry Dataset](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17MlyGtZMD4BNEA8UfNF8o_3rvRCOPKVdkONJy6J7oVM/edit) and we clarified that the dataset covers a subset of 311 phone calls, some of which result in a service request and some of which don't.
